# Churn Prediction

What exactly is Customer Churn? It is when an existing customer, user, player, subscriber or any kind of return client stops doing business or ends the relationship with a company. It can be defined in a variety of ways.

Contractual churn, or when a customer is under contract for a service and decides to cancel their service. This can be found in Cable TV, and SaaS products.

Voluntary churn is when a user voluntarily cancels a service and includes Prepaid Cell Phones, Streaming Subsriptions.

Non-Contractual or when a customer is not under contract for a service is the next example of churn, and includes consumer loyalty at a retail location or online browsing.

Finally involuntary churn, or when a churn occurs not at the request of the customer and includes, credit card expiration, or utilties being shut off by the provider.

Most likely, you as a customer have cancelled a service for a variety of reasons including lack of usage, poor service, or better price. Being able to leverage this experience as well as your domain knowledge will help guide you in your churn modeling journey.

Here, churn is defined by the customer cancelling their plan at a given point in time and is encoded in the dataset as no and yes.
